This is a library designed to facilitate sharing unit tests between Google Web
Toolkit code and native Java code. It has features to make it easier to test
asynchronous logic. To use these, you put a beginAsyncTestBlock() call at the
start of your test method, and an endAsyncTestBlock() call at the end of your
test method. Then, in an asynchronous callback, you invoke finished() when the
callback you are testing has completed. The code will wait ten seconds for a
call to finished(), and then fail with a TimeoutException.

This library depends on the "Awaitility" async java library, which has already
been included in the "lib" directory in jar form.

Code is Creative Commons Zero (see COPYING).
